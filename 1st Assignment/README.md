# 🧠 Assignment 7: Explain Core Network Terms  
**Instructor:** Mr. Vyshnavu  

---

## 🎯 What to Do:
Create a simple guide explaining **5 important networking concepts** with pictures.

## 📋 Scenario:
You're teaching someone the basics of how networks work — like explaining how mail gets delivered.

## 🔧 How:
Research and create simple explanations with diagrams for:
- NAT  
- ARP  
- MAC  
- IPv4  
- IPv6  

## ❓ Why:
Understanding these terms is fundamental to cybersecurity — you can't protect what you don't understand.

## 🛠️ Methodology

To complete this assignment:

1. I identified the **5 core networking concepts**.
2. I conducted research using **trusted technical sources** like TechTarget and Wikipedia.
3. For each term, I:
   - Wrote a **simplified explanation** in my own words.
   - Created a **real-world analogy** to make it relatable.
   - Added **placeholder diagrams** to visually represent each concept.
4. Compiled all information into a **one-page Markdown guide**, following a structured format.

## 📊 Report: One-Page Networking Fundamentals Guide

### 📌 1. **NAT (Network Address Translation)**  
**Definition:** NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address by translating local addresses into one external address.  
**Analogy:** Like a neighborhood post office using one official address for all houses. Outgoing mail is stamped with the post office's address (the router), and the post office sorts incoming mail back to each home.

### 📌 2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**  
**Definition:** ARP finds a device’s physical (MAC) address given its IP address by broadcasting a request on the local network.  
**Analogy:** Like posting a note asking "Who lives at House #A?" and only the right resident replies with their apartment number (MAC address).  
**Diagram:**

---

### 📌 3. **MAC Address**  
**Definition:** A MAC address is a unique hardware identifier burned into each network interface.  
**Analogy:** Like a permanent name on a house’s mailbox — it ensures any network data goes to the correct house.  
**Diagram:**

---

### 📌 4. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)**  
**Definition:** IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses written in four decimal numbers (e.g., 192.168.0.1).  
**Analogy:** Like old postal ZIP codes — there were only so many 4-digit codes, and we’re running out of them.  
**Diagram:**

---

### 📌 5. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)**  
**Definition:** IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses written in eight hexadecimal groups.  
**Analogy:** Like upgrading to really long ZIP codes with trillions of combinations — we won’t run out of addresses anymore.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- The **importance of IP addressing** in managing modern networks.
- How **NAT** helps preserve public IPs by translating private addresses.
- The role of **ARP** in connecting IP-level communication with hardware-level MAC addresses.
- Why **MAC addresses** are critical for device identification in local networks.
- The **limitations of IPv4** and the **advantages of IPv6** in supporting the growing number of internet-connected devices.
- That using **real-world analogies** makes technical topics easier to understand and remember.
